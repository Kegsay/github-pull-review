The format for events that get sent to the client (for the most part) is a subset of keys that are sent over federation. Due to all the signing that goes on I always think of the federation event format to be canonical, while the (current) c-s format is simply a stripped down version.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions are \"full\" and \"stripped\"/\"partial\"/\"collapsed\" or something like that. At the very least can we change the value \"events\" to something else so that its clear that the stripped down versions of events are *not* the canonical format?\r\n\r\nScrollback\r\n--------------\r\nThe scrollback API doesn't seem to have a way of indicating the various states it could be in when returning less than the limit:\r\n\r\n- There are no more events in the room (i.e., we've paginated back to the start).\r\n- The server needs to talk to other servers to get more events (or is in the process of doing so).\r\n- The server has tried to find more events, but no other server has returned anything more. (We could still potentially retry again later.) "

For the /sync API, what I really want is to say \"``limit=10`` for this filter ID, but return results from this filter ID\" which is awkward since we don't currently support that. I want the web client to get all events (for display in the room dialog), but I want to apply ``limit=10`` for displayable events.\r\n\r\n> in terms of the API changes, it would just be something like ``filter_limit=$filter_id``  I guess, so it's not the end of the world, but I need to work through an exact example of what that would look like. I guess all ``filter_limit`` is doing is serving as the filter to determine what counts as \"10\" when you say ``limit=10``, but return results by filtering on ``filter=``\r\n\r\nThis concept needs to be added to the HTTP spec. The use case being the web client: I want to display the 10 most recent displayable events, but I want to *receive* all the different event types evar so I can populate the state events dialog, which currently you can't do."

    "body": "> events_filter or timeline_filter or even graph_filter?\r\n\r\nGiven these are events which appear in the ``events`` key for a room, I like ``events_filter``.\r\n\r\n> Should control over what state is filtered and what events are filtered be part of the filter itself?\r\n\r\nMy gut reaction originally said \"no, the filter just controls which events are obtained and how each event is represented (eg which keys), not *room* related stuff\". However, there is already a precedent for modifying global/room stuff via ``public_user_data: true,`` and co. Therefore, I agree with Mark and think that this should probably form part of the filter. If it is part of the filter, should we be mimicking the structure of the ``/sync`` response more to make the relation clearer? Something like:\r\n```\r\nroom: {\r\n  state: {\r\n    types: [\"something\"],\r\n    not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n  },\r\n  events: {\r\n    types: [\"something\"],\r\n    not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich would end up with rather satisfyingly symmetric filter request keys/sync response keys:\r\n```\r\nCreating filter:\r\n{\r\n  room: {\r\n    state: {\r\n      types: [\"something\"],\r\n      not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n    },\r\n    events: {\r\n      types: [\"something\"],\r\n      not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  public_user_data: true,\r\n  private_user_data: true\r\n}\r\n\r\nSync response:\r\n{\r\n  next_batch: \"foo\",\r\n  rooms: [\r\n    {\r\n      state: [ event_ids ],\r\n      events: [ event_ids ],\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  public_user_data: [\r\n    { event }\r\n  ],\r\n  private_user_data: [\r\n    { event }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDo we want public/private user data to just be bools at this point? If they are, which filter is applied when I say ``public_user_data: true``? The state one? It's not clear. We also need clear guidelines on what would be public_user_data (e.g. an event without a ``room_id``)."

    "body": "That looks good to me. This way you know exactly what you're filtering on for each key in ``/sync``. As for determining the \"pool\" of events that you're filtering on, the room ones are fairly obvious (timeline order for ``events`` and presence of ``state_key`` for ``state``), but the other 2 are more interesting. Presumably, the absence of a ``room_id`` means that it is ``public_user_data``, but where does typing fit into this?\r\n\r\nWe need to work out the semantics for ``private_user_data`` too. Given it's user only, and given it's just a generic store, it is probably Good Enough to just say \"hey, if you PUT stuff to your private userdata then you can filter on it if you know which events you're working with\". I would typically use this to store app-specific config info in my own event type namespace e.g. ``org.matrix.console.android.*`` and then use that as my filter on ``private_user_data``."

    "body": "So the outstanding problems on this are:\r\n- Where do ``m.typing`` events go?\r\n- Where do server-generated events not scoped to a room go?\r\n\r\nThe general API mentions that there should be a prefix to the event type to indicate state/message/ephemeral event. We currently determine the different kinds of events based on the keys e.g. ``state`` vs ``events`` vs ``public_user_data``, so it may be worth adding in different sections for these kinds of events? E.g.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n room: {\r\n   state: {\r\n     types: [\"something\"],\r\n     not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n   },\r\n   events: {\r\n     types: [\"something\"],\r\n     not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n   },\r\n   ephemeral: {\r\n     types: [\"something\"],\r\n     not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n   }\r\n },\r\n public_user_data: {\r\n   types: [\"something\"],\r\n   not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n },\r\n private_user_data: {\r\n   types: [\"something\"],\r\n   not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n },\r\n server_data: {\r\n   types: [\"something\"],\r\n   not_senders: [\"@foo:bar\"]\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis covers all the different kinds of events which exist (or are planned to exist in the future):\r\n- Room state events like ``m.room.name`` : ``room.state``\r\n- Room events (state and message) like ``m.room.message``: ``room.events``\r\n- Room EDUs like ``m.typing``: ``room.ephemeral``\r\n- Private user data like push/app specific configs: ``private_user_data``\r\n- Public user data like ``m.profile`` and ``m.presence``: ``public_user_data``\r\n- Server-generated events (not room scoped): ``server_data``\r\n- Server-generated events (room-scoped), with modified ``sender`` as per general API: ``room.events``\r\n\r\nThis would negate the need to prefix event types since you can tell what kind of event it is based on the key it is inside of. For sending those event types, you hit different CS endpoints e.g. ``/user/{userId}/public/{eventType}`` for ``public_user_data``, ``/room/{roomId}/state/{eventType}/{stateKey}`` for ``room.state``, and so on."
